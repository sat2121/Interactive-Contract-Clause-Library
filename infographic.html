    <title>Infographic: The Anatomy of an Indian Contract</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Energetic & Playful -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The infographic is structured as a narrative scrollable page. It begins with a high-level "Anatomy of a Contract" diagram to orient the user to the main clause categories. This is followed by a bar chart visualizing the 'Clause Distribution' to give a quantitative sense of the library. A 'Dispute Lifecycle' flowchart then illustrates the practical application of key clauses in a conflict scenario. Finally, an interactive 'Clause Deep Dive' section uses an accordion UI, allowing users to explore the detailed content of each of the 50 clauses without being overwhelmed. This top-down structure‚Äîfrom holistic view to granular detail‚Äîis chosen to make the dense legal information digestible and engaging for a professional audience. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1. Contract Anatomy -> Goal: Organize -> Viz: HTML/CSS Diagram -> Justification: A hub-and-spoke diagram is the clearest way to show the core categories that form a contract. 2. Clause Count -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Justification: A bar chart provides an immediate quantitative comparison of the volume of clauses in each category. 3. Dispute Lifecycle -> Goal: Organize (Process) -> Viz: HTML/CSS Flowchart -> Justification: A flowchart is the standard and most intuitive way to represent a sequential process. 4. Clause Details -> Goal: Inform -> Presentation: Interactive Accordion (HTML/JS) -> Justification: An accordion is ideal for presenting large amounts of structured text on a single page without excessive scrolling, allowing users to self-select the information they need. -->
