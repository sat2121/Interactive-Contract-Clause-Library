    <title>Interactive Contract Clause Library</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A two-panel "Interactive Clause Explorer" design was chosen. A persistent left-hand navigation panel lists all 50 clauses, grouped by category, allowing for quick discovery and access. This panel includes search and category filtering for efficiency. The right-hand content panel dynamically displays the details (Objective, Preset, Drafting Considerations) of the selected clause. This structure is superior to a single-column layout as it prevents endless scrolling, provides constant context of the library's structure, and supports the primary user tasks of finding, understanding, and copying specific clauses without losing their place. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: 50 structured text-based legal clauses. Goal: Organize, Inform, and enable use. Viz/Presentation Method: The core is an interactive two-panel layout. A filterable navigation list (HTML/JS) is used to organize and access clauses. The clause content is presented in structured text blocks with a dedicated `<pre>` tag for the legal preset. Interaction: Users click a clause in the nav to display its content. A search bar and category dropdown filter the nav list. A "Copy" button is provided for each preset. Justification: This design directly addresses the user need to efficiently navigate a large library of text. Since the source data is qualitative, traditional charts are not applicable. The interactive list and copy function are the most effective tools. Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript for logic, Tailwind CSS for styling. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

INTERPRETATION:\n(a) The headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.\n(b) Unless the context otherwise requires, words in the singular shall include the plural and vice versa.\n(c) Any reference to a statute or statutory provision is a reference to it as amended, extended, or re-enacted from time to time.\n(d) The schedules and annexures form an integral part of this Agreement and shall have the same force and effect as if expressly set out in the body of this Agreement.`, considerations: "Arrange definitions alphabetically. Define terms that have a specific, technical, or repeated meaning within the contract." },

Specify a \"long-stop date\" by which they must be met and the consequences of failure (e.g., termination)." },
                    { id: 4, title: "Term & Duration", objective: "To specify the length of time the agreement is effective.", preset: `This Agreement shall be deemed to have commenced on [Start Date] (the “Effective Date”) and shall continue in full force and effect for an initial period of [Number] [Months/Years] (the “Initial Term”), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Upon the expiry of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive periods of [Renewal Period, e.g., one year] each, unless either Party provides the other with written notice of its intent not to renew at least [Number] days prior to the end of the then-current term.`, considerations: "Clearly distinguish between the date of signing and the \"Effective Date\" from which obligations begin. The auto-renewal clause is common but requires careful tracking to avoid unintended extensions." },

The Service Provider agrees to perform the Services:\n(a) with a high degree of professionalism and in a timely, effective, and efficient manner;\n(b) in accordance with the highest industry standards and best practices;\n(c) in compliance with all specifications, instructions, and timelines provided by the Client; and\n(d) by deploying personnel with the requisite skills, qualifications, and experience.\n\nAny material change to the Scope of Work shall be mutually agreed upon in writing through a formal Change Order Request signed by both Parties.`, considerations: "For anything complex, always use a schedule/annexure. Clearly state what is included and, if necessary, what is excluded to avoid scope creep. A change control process is vital." },

Each invoice must quote the relevant Purchase Order number and provide sufficient detail to enable the Client to assess the Services performed.\n(c) The Client shall pay all undisputed amounts on each invoice within [Number] days of its receipt. All payments are subject to the deduction of applicable taxes at source (TDS) as required under Applicable Law.\n(d) In the event of a disputed invoice, the Client shall pay the undisputed portion and the Parties shall work in good faith to resolve the disputed amount within [Number] days.\n(e) The Fees are exclusive of Goods and Services Tax (GST), which shall be charged at the prevailing rate and be borne by the Client.`, considerations: "Specify the currency, invoicing cycle, due dates, and responsibility for taxes.

The exercise of such right of set-off shall be without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to the Client under this Agreement or at law.`, considerations: "This is a client-friendly clause. A service provider will often try to resist or delete this clause, or at least limit it to undisputed amounts owed under the *same* agreement." },

Any delay in performance by the Service Provider shall be considered a material breach of this Agreement, entitling the Client to exercise its remedies, including but not limited to termination and/or a claim for damages.`, considerations: "This clause significantly strengthens the position of the party awaiting performance. Under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, this makes contractual timelines a condition of the contract, not just a warranty." },
                    { id: 9, title: "Deliverables & Milestones", objective: "To outline specific outputs and timelines for the project.", preset: `The Service Provider shall provide the deliverables (the “Deliverables”) and achieve the milestones (the “Milestones”) in accordance with the timeline and specifications set out in **Schedule B**.\n(a) **Acceptance Testing:** Each Deliverable shall be subject to review and acceptance by the Client. The Client shall have [Number] Business Days from the receipt of a Deliverable to conduct testing and notify the Service Provider in writing of its acceptance or rejection, along with detailed reasons for any rejection.\n(b) **Deemed Acceptance:** If the Client fails to provide notice of rejection within the specified period, the Deliverable shall be deemed to have been accepted.\n(c) **Rectification:** If a Deliverable is rejected, the Service Provider shall have [Number] Business Days to rectify the defects and resubmit the Deliverable for acceptance.`, considerations: "Clearly define what constitutes a \"Deliverable\" and the objective criteria for its \"acceptance\" to ensure clarity and avoid payment disputes." }

Provided, however, that the Client may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate or to a successor entity in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all of its assets, upon providing written notice to the Service Provider. Any assignment attempted in violation of this clause shall be void ab initio. The Service Provider shall remain fully liable for the performance of any permitted subcontractor.`, considerations: "A client may allow subcontracting to specific, pre-approved vendors.

The cost of the audit shall be borne by the Client, unless the audit reveals a material discrepancy or breach, in which case the reasonable costs of the audit shall be borne by the Service Provider.`, considerations: "Limit the frequency of audits and ensure confidentiality obligations apply to the auditors. Specify the process for rectifying any discrepancies found." },

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, or employment relationship between the Parties. Neither Party has any authority to create any obligation or responsibility on behalf of or in the name of the other Party. The Service Provider's personnel shall not be entitled to any benefits, such as provident fund, gratuity, or insurance, which the Client provides to its own employees.`, considerations: "This is a critical clause in service agreements to mitigate risks related to co-employment and vicarious liability under Indian labour laws." },

The Service Provider shall not remove or reassign any of the Key Personnel without the prior written consent of the Client, unless such removal is due to resignation, termination of employment, or illness. In such event, the Service Provider shall promptly provide a replacement with at least equivalent qualifications and experience, subject to the Client's approval.`, considerations: "This is used when the client is relying on the specific expertise of certain individuals.

If a Force Majeure Event prevents performance for a continuous period of more than sixty (60) days, the non-affected Party may terminate this Agreement by giving thirty (30) days' written notice.`, considerations: "The list of events should be carefully considered.

It prevents a developer, for instance, from later demanding that their name be attached to the software they coded." },

The Client reserves the right to review and approve any use of the Client IP to ensure quality control.`, considerations: "Specify the scope of the license (e.g., for use only in a specific territory), its duration, and whether it is exclusive or non-exclusive.
